Git Commmands

First we will create a FORK and then we will clone the copy in our local.

git checkout master 
git checkout -b create_branch
git remote add upstream cloned (url of main repo from which the fork is created)
git fetch upstream  //It will fetch all the branches
git merge upstream/repo_branch_name[adithya]
git add files 
git commit
git push origin/local_branch[adithya-dev]	
compare and pull request.(create the PR from UI===Compare across forks)
